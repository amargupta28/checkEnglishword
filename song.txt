Durga, Durga, Mother Tara, luxiator in sorrows.
Unconquerable Kali of the South, the daughter of Nagendra!
Ten-armed Mother Chandi on guard in ten directions --
Her third eye glitters brightly in the center of her forehead,
And her children, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik, and Ganesh.
The lion, the asura, Jaya and Bijaya, accompany the Mother.
